// [line 3] Error at '{': Expected expression

// // I don't believe that this test is correct
// Original: [line 3] Error at ')': Expected ';' after expression
// The missing semicolon is because there isn't an expression statement in the block {}, but rlox doesn't error due to it being in panic mode
// It's enough of an edge case that it should be fine to ignore, it prints the important error anyway
